As part of our ongoing relationship with European Athletics we went out to help with the European Cross Country Championships in Chia, Sardinia. A fantastic weekend with many British medals was matched by the success of our timing system. In our role as back-up to the big boys of Swiss Timing, Andy Weir and 3 local volunteers managed to capture the finishers and calculate the team results live. In fact we had them out before the ‘live’ BBC transmission showed them.
