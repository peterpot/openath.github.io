We did our first tests of the standalone OpenTrack system at the Thames

We'd previously tried out our back end API at the last Surrey League race on 14th February, and learned a lot of lessons.  The changes this time were...

 - a custom HTML keypad with bigger buttons than the normal iPhone dialogs
 - gloves and styluses, to prevent freezing fingers
 - separate modes for recorders and timekeepers
 
Things went well on the recording at the back of the funnel.  The challenges were fairly mundane:  a lack of pins resulted in many people with flapping numbers, and we only had two people on the funnel.

We also shot a finish line video using a GoPro-style camera.
