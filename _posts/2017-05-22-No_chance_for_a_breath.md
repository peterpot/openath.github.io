title: No chance to breathe, onto Night of the 10,000m PB’s
author: Andy Weir

Just because we are gluttons for punishment, one week after the county champs we got involved in probably the most exciting event currently on the British Athletics Calendar. The Night of the 10,000m PB’s is part athletics fest, including the UKA champs, part beer festival and 100% fun. 7,000 fans turned up including Seb Coe and Paula Radcliffe.

We took the entries and worked with the tireless promoter Ben Pochee on the constantly changing race line up. We think we added bit of colour to the programme as we added club details, Pb’s and targets from our database. However, the big test for us was the live results….and they worked. As soon as the awesome photofinisher timing team, including Don Anderson and the indefatigable Jeanne Coker, had verified the results they were automatically on our website.  "https://entries.opentrack.run/2017/not/"  has never had so much traffic. It was also a vital step on our work with EA on the data capture project.
